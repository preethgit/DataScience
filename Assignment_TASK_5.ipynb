If the imbalanced data is directly used, the model would tend to predict non-adopted users to achieved higher accuracy but lose the ability to identify potential adopted users. Therefore, I choose the under sampling method to combat the imbalance issue and leverage the state of art machine learning technology to build the prediction model. The evaluation metric is set to be AUC rather than accuracy due to the goal and imbalanced data set.\n",

The small size companies tend to have higher adoption rate than the larger companies. For referral, if the user is referred by adopted users, the person is more likely to become adopted user in the future.\n",

        "I conclude by saying, most of the adopted users are from a relatively small organization with high adoption rate in the organization and referred by adopted user; meanwhile, users from certain email domains have lower adoption rate than others. Overall, the adoption rate in the organization plays the most important role in determining whether the new users will adopt in the future."
